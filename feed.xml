In contrast, (social) allostasis proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental demands, aligning with von Foerster’s “order through noise” principle. This paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic regulation that employs bio-physiologically inspired signal transducers, analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of “animats” across several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage environmental and social ``noise’’ for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems.</em></p> <p>I am happy to discuss this (and/or any other) paper in more detail, and welcome any invites to workshops, research seminars, etc. Please feel free to <a href="mailto: imy@imytk.co.uk">get in touch</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Societal Outreach Initiatives for Artificial Life Workshop at ALIFE2025 (Kyoto, Japan)</title><link href="https://imytk.github.io/blog/2025/alife-outreach-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Societal Outreach Initiatives for Artificial Life Workshop at ALIFE2025 (Kyoto, Japan)"/><published>2025-04-23T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-23T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://imytk.github.io/blog/2025/alife-outreach-workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://imytk.github.io/blog/2025/alife-outreach-workshop/"><![CDATA[<p>Updated 29 August</p> <p>Along with Emily Dolson, I will be hosting the “Societal Outreach Initiatives for Artificial Life” workshop at ALIFE2025, where we try to improve the outreach efforts for Artificial Life.</p> <p>Does ALIFE have a “marketing problem”?</p> <p>Despite significant scientific advancements in Artificial Life over the past four decades, its impact and understanding remains largely confined to academic circles. While initiatives like the ALIFE newsletter, encyclopaedia, various podcasts, and other web resources are attempting to address this, we believe more direct public engagement is crucial. Having outreach channels that can directly communicate artificial life to the public offers an excellent way to promote artificial life as a field, as well as improve public scientific literacy. Improving public knowledge in this way also provides a potential buffer against disinformation or mischaracterisation of artificial life research in the future.</p> <p>This interactive workshop aims to bring together conference attendees interested in extending the reach of artificial life to the wider public. We will begin with short invited talks showcasing current outreach efforts and then break out into roundtable discussions to brainstorm how we can improve current initiatives and generate new ways to improve the societal outreach of artificial life.</p> <p>This workshop aims to serve as a springboard for 1-3 new societal outreach initiatives, which attendees will be encouraged to champion and further develop.</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to register their interest and prepare potential ideas and discussion points in advance, although space will be provided for new ideas on the day. You can register and submit ideas in advance by clicking <a href="https://forms.gle/7rUVJhb67sMYp7nv5">this link</a>.</p> <p>Timings of the 90-minute workshop will be confirmed as soon as we know them.</p> <p>Current schedule:</p> <ul> <li>Overview: ALife Newsletter (Claus Aranha) - 15 minutes</li> <li>Overview: ALife Encyclopaedia (Emily Dolson) - 15 minutes</li> <li>Overview: Complexity Cat (Amahury J.L. Diaz) - 15 minutes</li> <li>Brainstorm/break-out session - 45 minutes</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="workshops"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Updated 29 August]]></summary></entry></feed>
