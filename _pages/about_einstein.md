# Research

As of 2025, I currently an independent researcher, working in areas of bio-inspired intelligence, artificial life, embodied (social and affective) cognition, artificial intelligence (both basic and applied research), affective computing, human-robot interaction, and adaptive systems/cybernetics. 

Between 2022-2024, I was awarded a EUTOPIA-SIF MSCA Fellowship, working at the University of Gothenburg (DICE Lab) on the project "Socially Assistive Robot Partners for Digitized Cognitive Intervention Therapy (SARP-DCI)." 

Before that, I worked on the interdisciplinary project, _"Diversity Creates Diversity: Helping Nature-Recovery Meet the Diverse Needs of People and Nature"_, funded through the NERC Discipline Hopping Grant, at the [Sandom Lab](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/sandomlab/) in 2022.
 
# Outreach

I am part of the [ALife Newsletter](https://alife.org/category/newsletter/) coordination team: a bi-monthly digital publication for Artificial Life (ALife) community updates.

I host the [What ALife! Podcast](/podcast/) and also occasionally co-host on the [BiotaCast](https://biotacast.org/) podcast. 

I am the **General Chair** for the Emerging Researchers in Artificial Life group & the **Social Outreach Chair** for the International Society of Artificial Life (ISAL) for 2024-2026.
_Note: You can join the [ERA Discord server here](https://discord.gg/rbzddE6SHH)._

I also coordinate the ALife & Society Special Interest group which hosts a seminar series and an interdisciplinary working group.

I regularly co-organise the ALIFE & Society Special Session as part of the ALIFE conference.

# Personal(?)

I train and occasionally compete as a hybrid fitness athlete.
