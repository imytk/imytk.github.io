Hi, I'm Imy Khan: a researcher primarily working on artificial life, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction. 

I'm mostly interested in nature (or bio-)inspired intelligence, self-organisation/adaptive systems/cybernetics, social and affective cognition, and the intersection of all of these things. 

For instance, why do social (biological) agents demonstrate better adaptability than non-social agents? What is happening "under the hood"? Why did "emotions" evolve the way they did, and  how do they affect our ability to self-regulate, self-organise, and adapt? Can these things give us clues about how to build truly intelligent, adaptive artificial intelligence? 

This also extends to our relationships with artificial systems (like robots): can we _truly_ form "social bonds" with robots the same way we do with other humans? How does this influence our long-term health, and the way we socially interact with these artificial systems? 

These (along with dozens more) questions are what I like to explore, using whatever tools that are available to me.

Though I mostly work independently, I hold a number of affiliations: I am currently a part-time Research Fellow at the University of Warwick (UK), an Affiliated Researcher at [DICE Lab](https://www.dice-r-lab.com/) at the University of Gothenburg (Sweden), and a visiting lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire (UK). 

I also work as an external consultant for private institutions and government organisations across many AI, machine learning, and data science-related areas.

I also try to maintain some public outreach activities for the artificial life community: you can read more on my [about me](/people/) page.
