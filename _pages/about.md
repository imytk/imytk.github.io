Hi, I'm Imy Khan: a researcher primarily working on artificial life, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction. 

**Research:** I'm interested in nature (or bio-)inspired intelligence, self-organisation/adaptive systems/cybernetics, social and affective cognition, human-robot interaction, and the intersection of all of these things. Read more on my [about me](/people/) page.

**Affiliations**: Though I mostly work independently, I hold a number of academic affiliations: I am currently a part-time Research Fellow at the University of Warwick (UK), an Affiliated Researcher at [DICE Lab](https://www.dice-r-lab.com/) at the University of Gothenburg (Sweden), and a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire (UK). 

**AI & ML Consultancy**: Click [here](/consultancy/) for more information.

**Other**: I also try to maintain some public outreach activities for the artificial life community. I am also the Lead Coach at [enactive Performance](https://enactive.co.uk).
