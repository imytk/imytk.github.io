#AI and ML Consultancy

With over 13 years of experience, I am a highly innovative and results-oriented AI consultant, holding a PhD in Artificial Intelligence combined with deep experience across a diverse range of industry sectors. I specialise in guiding organisations to strategically implement AI and machine learning solutions. My approach combines rigorous academic insight with practical industry application, enabling me to translate complex AI concepts into tangible business advantages, drive innovation, and foster data-driven cultures. My capabilities extend to effective stakeholder management and the development of high-performing teams, ensuring successful project delivery and robust internal capability enhancement.

My consultancy services provide comprehensive support across the entire AI/ML development and deployment lifecycle. This begins with meticulous requirement analysis and strategic roadmap development, ensuring AI initiatives are precisely aligned with core business objectives. I lead the engineering of custom AI solutions, leveraging advanced predictive analytics, large language models, and intelligent process automation to streamline operations and enhance efficiency.  These solutions are built with a focus on robust and scalable deployment using industry-standard frameworks and deployment tools. Throughout this process, I integrate MLOps best practices, from rigorous model testing via CI/CD pipelines to seamless deployment on local and cloud platforms, and continuous performance monitoring. Beyond technical implementation, I offer expertise in establishing new AI functions and providing mentorship to empower your personnel, enabling them to confidently build, deploy, and manage their own AI systems, supported by strong data analytics and business intelligence capabilities.
