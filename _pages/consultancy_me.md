\#Strategic AI \& Machine Learning Consultancy

With a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and over 15 years of experience spanning industry and academia, I guide organisations in strategically implementing AI and machine learning solutions that deliver a clear competitive advantage.



My approach bridges rigorous academic insight with practical, hands-on industry application, translating complex AI and machine learning concepts into tangible business value, creating custom solutions, driving innovation, and fostering a data-driven culture at scale.



I partner with both leadership and technical teams, aligning on a shared vision for AI that ensures every initiative is precisely scoped and integrated to meet your core business objectives. My client portfolio includes Tesco (UK), Ocado (UK), Amazon (UK), Saudi Aramco (KSA), BT Group (UK), ASOS (UK), HEAL: Helping, Educating, And Rebuilding Lives (PK), and many more.



\#End-to-End AI Development \& Capability Building

My expertise covers the entire AI development and deployment lifecycle. I specialise in building and delivering custom AI solutions, from advanced predictive analytics and intelligent process automation to leveraging cutting-edge solutions (e.g. Large Language Models) for enhanced productivity.



Beyond the technical implementation, my core focus is on building robust, scalable, and production-ready systems. I apply MLOps best practices, including CI/CD pipelines, to ensure seamless deployment and continuous performance monitoring. My goal is to deliver not just a model, but a sustainable, production-grade system your team can own and maintain.

I work with your team to address their specific challenges, providing the expertise they need to take ownership of their AI journey. This mentorship and upskilling drive long-term value, ensuring your team has the skills and confidence to succeed.
