# Overview


As a strategic AI consultant with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and over 15 years of experience, I help organisations navigate the complexities of AI, machine learning, and data science. By blending rigorous academic insights with my vast experience in the private sector, my goal is to translate these technologies into meaningful applications for your organisation. I work with you and your teams to develop custom solutions, optimise existing processes, and upskill your teams through training courses and workshops to foster a data-driven culture across all levels.


I partner with both leadership and technical teams, aligning on a shared vision for AI that ensures every initiative is precisely scoped and integrated to meet your core business objectives.



My client portfolio includes Tesco (UK), Ocado (UK), Amazon (UK), Saudi Aramco (KSA), BT Group (UK), ASOS (UK), HEAL: Helping, Educating, And Rebuilding Lives (PK), and many more.



# End-to-End AI Deployment



My expertise covers the entire AI development and deployment lifecycle. I specialise in building and delivering custom AI solutions, from advanced forecasting/predictive analytics and intelligent process automation to leveraging cutting-edge solutions (e.g. Large Language Models) across a variety of use-cases.



Beyond just the technical implementation, I focus on building robust, scalable, and production-ready systems. I apply MLOps best practices, including CI/CD pipelines, to ensure seamless deployment and continuous performance monitoring. This way, you are left with a sustainable, production-grade system that your team can own and maintain.



# Custom Training & Capability Building



I am passionate about empowering your internal teams to confidently build, deploy, and manage their own AI systems, creating long-lasting capability and autonomy over these solutions. I develop and lead custom training courses and workshops tailored to your organisation's specific needs, from foundational concepts for new teams to advanced topics for seasoned professionals. I offer seminars and workshops to both technical and leadership teams. I can work with your team to address their specific challenges, providing the expertise they need to take ownership of their AI journey.
