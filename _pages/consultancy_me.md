With a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and over 15 years of experience spanning industry and academia, I work with organisations to strategically implement AI/machine learning solutions and a data-driven culture that allows them to stay ahead of the competition.



My approach bridges rigorous insights from academia with practical, hands-on industry application, translating complex AI and machine learning concepts into tangible value for your organisation, creating custom solutions, optimising existing processes, and fostering a data-driven culture at scale.



I partner with both leadership and technical teams, aligning on a shared vision for AI that ensures every initiative is precisely scoped and integrated to meet your core business objectives.



My client portfolio includes Tesco (UK), Ocado (UK), Amazon (UK), Saudi Aramco (KSA), BT Group (UK), ASOS (UK), HEAL: Helping, Educating, And Rebuilding Lives (PK), and many more.



# End-to-End AI Deployment



My expertise covers the entire AI development and deployment lifecycle. I specialise in building and delivering custom AI solutions, from advanced predictive analytics and intelligent process automation to leveraging cutting-edge solutions (e.g. Large Language Models) across a variety of use-cases.



Beyond just the technical implementation, I focus on building robust, scalable, and production-ready systems. I apply MLOps best practices, including CI/CD pipelines, to ensure seamless deployment and continuous performance monitoring. My goal is to deliver not just a tool, but a sustainable, production-grade system your team can own and maintain.



# Custom Training & Capability Building



I am passionate about empowering your internal teams to confidently build, deploy, and manage their own AI systems, creating long-lasting capability and autonomy over these solutions. I develop and lead custom training courses and workshops tailored to your organisation's specific needs, from foundational concepts for new teams to advanced topics for seasoned professionals. I can work with your team to address their specific challenges, providing the expertise they need to take ownership of their AI journey. 



# Get in Touch



Whether your organisation needs to know more about AI/ML foundations and development, develop custom AI solutions, optimise existing operational processes, or build robust internal AI or data science capabilities through customised training, I am confident I can offer the tailored expertise that align with your objectives.
